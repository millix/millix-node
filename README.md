## About millix

### Principles

- Currencies should not be created with debt.
- Currencies should operate at infinite scale.
- Currencies should work the same throughout the entire spectrum of transaction values.
- Currencies should be exchanged with no fee. 
- Currencies should be functional without carrying the weight of every previous transaction.
- Modern currencies should be at least as simple to use as primitive currencies.
- Implementing a digital currency into a process should be nearly the same effort as implementing paper cash into a process, where any additional difficulty implementing a digital currency is indisputably offset by benefits. 
- Simplicity at the edge is the only possible with equal simplicity in the foundation.
- Currencies are a product chosen by customers and supported by professionals. Customers and professionals require services and support.
- The cost of securing value can't exceed the value it secures.
- Decreasing a currency's value with inflation should not dilute the value of savers.
- Increasing a currency's market value should be proportionate to increases in its' fundamental value.
- Participants that increase fundamental value should be algorithmically incentivized.
